# Voice-Recognition-Device
Wireless Voice Recognition Interface to Assist People with Tetraplegia to Control their Environment

## Problem
A switch is an essential tool in enabling access to assistive technologies and devices (e.g. Wheelchair controls, mouse clicks on a PC, switch control of electronics, etc.)
Current switch solutions have limitations: Complex mounting. Intrusive. Fragile.
Assistive Technology Manager at Aspire UK wanted to increase the options of accessible switch.

### Requirements from user:
**User Profile**
- Person with tetraplegia 
- No physical movement below neck 
- No speech impairment 
- May be ventilated 
- Assume there is movement of the head but that any head movement will be being used to move a mouse pointer 
- No cognitive impairment

**User Environment**
- Hospital, office
- Home
- Outdoors
- In wheelchair 

**User Acceptance**
- Un-obtrusive, wearable 
- Easy to understand and learn, intuitive to use 
- Minimal set-up needed. Promotes independence. 
- Robust

## Goal
Design a device that enables a person with tetraplegia to trigger a switch action.

## Procedure
1. Send questionnaire and conduct short interview to understand detailed user requirements.
2. Design the electrical diagram, program the modules
3. Assemble the casing and overall device
4. Record instructions
7. Measure the performance
   * Different subjects
   * Different length of commands
   * Different environments
   * Different distance from computer

## Result
- Response to short commands:

Accuracy, sensitivity, precision, prevalence and false positive rate were calculated. For the group testing their own voice (blue column) all values were above 98%. Meanwhile, the result from testing the other’s voice had lower results for all the parameters, and a decrease in respect to increasing distance was visible.

- Response to longer commands:

There was a decrease in all parameters for all subjects compared to short commands. The highest value for testing own’s voice was 94.67%.

- Different environments:

## Summary
- Price below 100£
- Performance in different environments: Only 6% difference in accuracy and sensitivity
- Battery life 6 hours
- Compatibility with iOS, Windows
- Wireless
- Trigger 6 actions
